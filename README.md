# Signals-Applications with MATLAB
## 1) Echo Generation-Removal to an input audio signal
> Echo Generation using Convolution of an Impulse Response & the Input signal

> Echo Removal using deconvolution with FFT & IFFT 

## 2) Image Compression and Decompression 
> Image Compression by processing each of its color components (red,green,blue) in blocks of 8X8 pixels
  then compress each block using 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D DCT)
  
> Image Decompression by applying inverse 2D DCT to each block
